# Social Tok : Connecting People 
A Case study to analysis emerging social media site data to help them progress with huge incoming data.

Social Tok was founded by two engineering Students, one  from London and the other from India. They left in 2008 and both met in London to start their business. They started Social Tok because they saw an opportunity to  build on the foundation that their previous company started by creating a new platform where  content took center stage. Social Tok emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can  react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments.  This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user  feeds.   Over the past 5 years, Social Tok has reached over 500 million active users each month.  They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee  their scaling process effectively.   Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they  create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain. Out of the 250 people working at Social Tok, 200 of them are technical staff working on maintaining this highly complex technology.  Up until this point, they have not relied on any third-party firms to help them get to where they are. However there are 2 main reasons why they are now looking at bringing in external expertise: 
1)	They want to learn data best practices from a large corporation. Due to the nature of their business, they have a massive amount of data so they are keen on understanding how the world's biggest companies manage the challenges of big data.  
2)	They want to know the key insight of data to make data-driven decision
